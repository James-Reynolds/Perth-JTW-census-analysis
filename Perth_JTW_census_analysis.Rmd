# 1.0 Introduction
Monash University's Public Transport Research Group (PTRG) is looking at changes in travel behaviour in Perth surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Part of this work involves examining the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) journey-to-work data for the 2016 and 2021 censuses. Areas of interest are: 

- an aggregate analysis for all of the Greater Perth area;

- a disaggregate analysis for three groupings of Perth Local Government Areas (LGAs) defined in previous PTRG work as: the North-south grouping^[City of Melville, City of South Perth, City of Stirling, City of Joondalup, City of Wanneroo, City of Cockburn, City of Kwinana, City of Rockingham, City of Murray and City of Mandurah.], the Heritage grouping ^[City of Bayswater, City of Belmont, City of Canning, City of Fremantle, City of Nedlands, City of Perth, City of Subiaco, City of Vincent, Shire of Peppermint Grove, Town of Bassendean, Town of Cambridge, Town of Claremont, Town of Cottesloe, Town of East Fremantle, Town of Mosman Park, Town of Victoria Park and City of Gosnells.] and the Outer-east grouping^[City of Kalamunda, City of Swan, Shire of Mundaring, City of Armadale, and Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale.].

-	Perth CBD^[Here the central City of Perth is adopted.]  / non-CBD-based Jobs, for all of Greater Perth and for the North-south, Heritage and Outer-east groupings
  
This working note details the process of collecting and reviewing the ABS data. It is structured as follows: the next section details the processing of the ABS data; Section 3 presents the results; followed by a brief discussion in Section 4; and conclusions in Section 5. 

# 2.0 Methods and data
The census provides data at a range of geographical scales and levels of detail. Ideally for this analysis the data would be downloaded at the lowest scale of interest, and then aggregated to larger areas^[For example, get the census data at LGA level for place of usual residence and place of work, then aggregate up to the three groupings and Greater Perth.]. However, a problem is that random alternations are made by the census to cells with small values so that individuals cannot be identified^[As this analysis is looking at 15 different JTW modes there will be a lot of small cells.].  Hence, aggregation will only combine these errors. Therefore it is necessary to download the data multiple times, at the highest geographical level needed for each part of the analsis.  


## 2.1 JTW for Greater Perth (usual residence)
Data tables for the 2016 and 2021 census were obtained for the journey to work mode for all of Greater Perth^[See Greater_Perth_UR_JTW_2016.csv and Greater_Perth_UR_JTW_2021.csv].


```{r load_abs_2021_2016_Greater_Perth_UR, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Perth 2021 destination zonea", cache=TRUE}
Greater_Perth_UR_JTW_2016 <- read_csv("~/0001 projects/Perth-JTW-census-analysis/01 data/Greater_Perth_UR_JTW_2016.csv", skip = 8)
Greater_Perth_UR_JTW_2021 <- read_csv("~/0001 projects/Perth-JTW-census-analysis/01 data/Greater_Perth_UR_JTW_2021.csv", skip = 8)

#drop unneeded rows and columns
Greater_Perth_UR_JTW_2016 <- tibble(Greater_Perth_UR_JTW_2016[2,1:17])
Greater_Perth_UR_JTW_2021 <- tibble(Greater_Perth_UR_JTW_2021[2,1:17])

#Clean names
Greater_Perth_UR_JTW_2016 <- clean_names(Greater_Perth_UR_JTW_2016)
Greater_Perth_UR_JTW_2021 <- clean_names(Greater_Perth_UR_JTW_2021)

#set names as consistent WATCH OUT, the order of walked_only and other_mode is flipped in the 2016 and 2021 data 
names(Greater_Perth_UR_JTW_2021) <- c("mtw15p_method_of_travel_to_work_15_travel_modes", "train", "bus", "ferry", "tram", "taxi", "car_as_driver", "car_as_passenger", "truck", "motorbike_scooter", "bicycle","other_mode", "walked_only", "worked_at_home", "did_not_go_to_work", "not_stated", "not_applicable")  

#set train column as numeric
Greater_Perth_UR_JTW_2016$train <- as.numeric(Greater_Perth_UR_JTW_2016$train)
Greater_Perth_UR_JTW_2021$train <- as.numeric(Greater_Perth_UR_JTW_2021$train)
```


## 2.2 JTW for by LGA (usual residence)
Data tables for the 2016 and 2021 census were obtained for the journey to work mode by LGA of Usual Residence (UR)^[For LGAs within Western Australia only.] and LGA of Place Of Work (POW)^[For all LGAs in Australia.]. The CSV files provide the LGA POW and mode volumes for each LGA UR in turn^[See Greater_Perth_JTW_by_DZ_and_LGA_2016.csv and Greater_Perth_JTW_by_DZ_and_LGA_2021.csv.]. To get these into a usable format^[i.e. a separate CSV file for each LGA UR.] the Table_Builder_Reader tool^[See https://github.com/vlc/table_builder_io/] was used. 



```{r load_abs_2021_2016_LGA_UR, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Perth 2021 destination zonea", cache=TRUE}


####Next add the JTW data by DZ and LGA
## by Year and DZ and LGA data from ABS comes in a single file, with multiple CSV sections for each LGA. I found https://pypi.org/project/table_builder_io/ which deals with this issue over in python.

#df2 = reader.read(as_index=False)

##then from https://stackoverflow.com/a/55168518
#for i in df2: 
#   df2[i].to_csv('dataframe_id_'+str(i)+'.csv')
##All of this results in an output of everything in a separated CSV for each LGA. 
##Some stuffing around required as python does not play well with '0's and / etc in file names

```

The "Total" row was extracted from each CSV file, to provide total mode volumes for each LGA of UR. The Heritage, North-south and Outer east groupings were added to the datasets.

## 2.3 JTW by LGA (usual residence) and LGA (place of work)
The same data tables were used as in Section 2.2 above, but this time the individual LGA POW rows were retained. The Heritage, North-south and Outer east groupings were added to the datasets as before, but a Place Of Work (POW) variable was also defined^[CBD (the City of Perth), the Rest of Greater Perth, and other places (rest of WA, rest of Australia).].

The age and employment data was also obtained so that population and employed population changes can be calculated for each of the Heritage, North-south and Outer east groupings^[See 2016_WA_Age_by_LGA.csv, 2021_WA_Age_by_LGA.csv, 2016_WA_employment_by_LGA.csv, 2021_WA_employment_by_LGA.csv.]. Note that the employment figures include all people who are employed or studying^[See definitions at https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/census-dictionary/2021/variables-topic/education-and-training/engagement-employment-education-and-training-eetp].

A Pearson's chi-squared test indicated that the relationship between census and JTW activity/mode was significant `r print_chi2(as.matrix(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1:2,c("private_vehicle_drive", "private_vehicle_passenger", "transit", "non_motorised", "other_mode", "worked_at_home")]))`.


The largest increase was in the number of people who drove a private vehicle (+`r label_number(big.mark = ",")(as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"private_vehicle_drive"])-as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"private_vehicle_drive"]))`, +`r label_percent()(as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"private_vehicle_drive"])/as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"private_vehicle_drive"])-1)`). The rate of increase in driving was at a higher rate than population growth (`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(as.numeric(Aggregate_pop_and_employed_UR_2016_2021_change[2,2]))`) and than the rate of growth in people employed or engaged in study (`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(as.numeric(Aggregate_pop_and_employed_UR_2016_2021_change[2,3]))`). However, the overall drive mode share dropped by a small amount(`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"private_vehicle_drive"]/(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"private_vehicle_drive"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"private_vehicle_passenger"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"transit"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"non_motorised"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"other_mode"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"worked_at_home"])) - as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"private_vehicle_drive"]/(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"private_vehicle_drive"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"private_vehicle_passenger"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"transit"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"non_motorised"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"other_mode"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"worked_at_home"])))`).


The number of people who worked from home also increased by a large amount, more than doubling to `r label_number(big.mark = ",")(as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"worked_at_home"]))` (+`r label_number(big.mark = ",")(as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"worked_at_home"])-as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"worked_at_home"]))`, `r label_percent()(as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"worked_at_home"])/as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"worked_at_home"])-1)`).

The number of people who commuted as a passenger in a private vehicle increased by `r label_number(big.mark = ",")(as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"private_vehicle_passenger"])-as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"private_vehicle_passenger"]))`(+`r label_percent()(as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"private_vehicle_passenger"])/as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"private_vehicle_passenger"])-1)`). Again, the rate of this increase is much larger than the rate of increase in population (`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(as.numeric(Aggregate_pop_and_employed_UR_2016_2021_change[2,2]))`) and than the rate of increase in the number of people who were employed and/or studying (`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(as.numeric(Aggregate_pop_and_employed_UR_2016_2021_change[2,3]))`). However, passenger mode share was relatively stable, only increasing by `r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"private_vehicle_passenger"]/(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"private_vehicle_drive"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"private_vehicle_passenger"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"transit"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"non_motorised"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"other_mode"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"worked_at_home"])) - as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"private_vehicle_passenger"]/(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"private_vehicle_drive"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"private_vehicle_passenger"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"transit"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"non_motorised"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"other_mode"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"worked_at_home"])))`. 


The use of non-motorised modes dropped, with the number of people cycling and walking falling by `r label_number(big.mark = ",")(-(as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"non_motorised"])-as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"non_motorised"])))`(`r label_percent()(as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"non_motorised"])/as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"non_motorised"])-1)`). The non-motorised mode share also fell by a small amount (`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"non_motorised"]/(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"private_vehicle_drive"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"private_vehicle_passenger"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"transit"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"non_motorised"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"other_mode"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"worked_at_home"])) - as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"non_motorised"]/(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"private_vehicle_drive"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"private_vehicle_passenger"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"transit"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"non_motorised"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"other_mode"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"worked_at_home"])))`).

Transit ridership fell (`r label_number(big.mark = ",")(as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"transit"])-as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"transit"]))`, `r label_percent()(as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"transit"])/as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"transit"])-1)`) as did the transit mode share (`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"transit"]/(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"private_vehicle_drive"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"private_vehicle_passenger"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"transit"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"non_motorised"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"other_mode"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"worked_at_home"])) - as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"transit"]/(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"private_vehicle_drive"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"private_vehicle_passenger"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"transit"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"non_motorised"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"other_mode"] + Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"worked_at_home"])))`).

However, again it is important to note that the Freemantle line was scheduled to be fully closed on the day of the census ^[See https://chartingtransport.com/category/mode-share/ which may be part of the reason for the drop in train (and perhaps also bus) ridership.].

Notably, the drop in the number of people commuting by non-motorised modes (walk or bike) was `r label_number(big.mark = ",", accuracy = 0.1)((as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"non_motorised"])-as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"non_motorised"]))/(as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"transit"])-as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"transit"])))` times larger than the loss in transit ridership, with `r label_number(big.mark = ",")(-(as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"non_motorised"])-as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"non_motorised"])))` fewer people walking or cycling to work in 2021 than in 2016 (equating to a fall of `r label_percent()(-(as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"non_motorised"])/as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"non_motorised"])-1))`).

A Pearson's chi-squared test indicated that the relationship between census and the shares of train, bus and ferry ridership was significant `r print_chi2(as.matrix(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1:2,c("train", "bus", "ferry")]))`.

The number of people who used the train fell by `r label_number(big.mark = ",")(-(as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"train"])-as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"train"])))`(`r label_percent()(-(as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[2,"train"])/as.numeric(Aggregate_JTW_2016_2021[1,"train"])-1))`).

WFH share increased for all usual residence and place of work combinations.  The largest increases were for travel to the (central) City of Perth (~+11%). Drive mode share increased the most for people living in the Outer-east whose place of work is in the City of Perth (+2.8%). It dropped overall (-1.8%), with the largest fall (-5.1%) amogst people who work somewhere other than in Greater Perth. Passenger mode share changes ranged from -0.5^[Outer-east usual residence to place of work in the (central) City of Perth.] to +0.6%^[Heritage usual residence to place of work in the (central) City of Perth.]. 
Non-motorised mode share fell for all groupings and places of work, but only by small amounts.  The largest change was -2.5% for people with a usual residence in the Heritage grouping and a place of work in the (central) City of Perth. 
The largest falls in mode share was amongst transit users with a place of work in the (central) City of Perth^[-11% overall, but -13.4% for people living in the Outer-east.], and did not increase in any of the sub-regions of Greater Perth. However, changes in transit mode share were relatively small for travel to places of work that were not in the central City of Perth, and for Greater Perth overall (ranging from -2% to -0.7%).  

Overall the changes in mode share suggest: 

- increases in the rate of WFH, especially amongst those with a place of work in the (central) City of Perth;
- a mix of change in driver mode share, with it falling overall but rising for people with a place of work in the (central) City of Perth; 
- a fall in transit mode share, especially amongst those with a place of work in the (central) City of Perth.

```

Across Greater Perth the largest changes between the 2016 and 2021 census journeys to work were the +64,936 additional drivers and the +45,130 additional people working from home.  The overall loss in transit ridership (-5,371) was similar to the loss in the number of non-motorised mode users (-4,707) and the gain in people travelling as a passenger in a private vehicle (+7,456). Note, however, that the Freemantle train line was closed on the day of the census ^[See https://web.archive.org/web/20210805204805/https://www.transperth.wa.gov.au/service-updates, thanks to https://chartingtransport.com/category/mode-share/], so this may have been a contributing factor to the reduction in transit ridership.  

Looking at the Heritage, North-south and Outer-east groupings individually, it appears that the North-south is where there has been most of the change in the number of drivers, passengers and transit riders.

The next table compares volume changes for the JTW to places of work that are within the (central) City of Perth LGA:



```{r summary_table_mode_ridership_differences_central_Perth, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

kable(transit_aggregate_summary_table_ridership_change[c(1, 5:8),] %>% adorn_totals(where = "col") %>% adorn_percentages(denominator = "row") %>% adorn_pct_formatting() %>% adorn_ns(), caption = "Summary of JTW volume changes between 2016 and 2021 census, Greater Perth and sub-groupings", col.names = c("UR", "POW", "Drive", "Passenger", "Transit", "Walk/Bike", "Other", "WFH", "Total"))




```

The values for the JTW to the central City of Perth suggest: 

- City of Perth POWs saw proportionally: 
  - less increase in driving
  - less decrease in transit use
  - less decrease in walk/bike use and 
  - more increase in WFH.
- transit ridership from the Heritage group of LGAs to the City of Perth actually went up (+724)^[Despite the scheduled closure of the Freemantle line.].  
- WFH as a proportion of volume changes related to a POW in the City of Perth: 
  - increased more in the North-south grouping (53.3%) and the Outer-east grouping (52.1%); whereas  
  - for people living in the Heritage grouping the proportaion (40.8%) was generally in line with that for all JTW travel in Greater Perth (40.6%)
was highest for those living in the North-south 

The next table shows volume changes related to places of work that are not in the (central) City of Perth.  


```{r summary_table_mode_ridership_differences_not_central_Perth, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

kable(transit_aggregate_summary_table_ridership_change[c(1, 9:13),] %>% adorn_totals(where = "col") %>% adorn_percentages(denominator = "row") %>% adorn_pct_formatting() %>% adorn_ns(), caption = "Summary of JTW volume changes between 2016 and 2021 census, Greater Perth and sub-groupings", col.names = c("UR", "POW", "Drive", "Passenger", "Transit", "Walk/Bike", "Other", "WFH", "Total"))




```

In general, it appears that the drop in transit ridership was larger for JTW to places other than the (central) City of Perth, especially: 

- for those living in the Heritage grouping of LGAs and travelling to the rest of Perth (-7.5%)

```

Drive and passenger ridership increased by up to 45%, especially for places of work within the City of Perth. Transit and walk/bike were mostly down.  WFH increased, especially for places of work within the (central) City of Perth.
